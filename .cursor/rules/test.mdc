Add tests for all changes in the tests/ directory:
1. Prefer unit tests (no cloud credentials needed)
2. Otherwise use end-to-end tests (no cloud credentials needed)
3. As last resort, use smoke tests in tests/smoke_tests/

Tests use pytest. Run with:
pytest -s -n 0 --dist=no <test-file-path>

Verify unit tests work after implementation.
